# intricacies-of-c
c exercises, but towards the fringes of the language

best use of this repo requires the bare minimum of having seen the breadth of the language in it's entirety at least once, like perhaps quickly finishing an introductory c book from cover to cover without doing actual coding

here we deal with depths of that breadth, by testing our understanding with actual implementations

all codes are explained by concise comment lines

this project is sparked by the realization that truly knowing c isn't just printing or reading text to/from terminal, using if-else clauses and for loops

truly knowing c is about:
* knowing whether and how the machine code changes by every single letter in the code
* where the components of a code are loaded on the memory, and why
* how is it that a program loaded onto the memory
* how is it that a program starts to execute, under what supervisions and protection mechanisms
* what are the possible actions taken by a specific processor, what's the instruction set
* how do different architectures affect performance and capabilities of the language
* how it all works on the actual circuitry of the computer or MCU
